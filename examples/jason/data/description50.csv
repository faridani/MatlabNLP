Love the styling of these  and since they are  the comfort is definitely there. I could even use my orthotic with them.
So weird -- most of the reviews I read said that they felt a little large. I felt the complete opposite! I usually wear an 8.5 or a 9. I ordered a 9 and they were uncomfortably small. They are cute but a little schoolmarm-y. I might order up and see how I feel about the style after.
"Best investment for walking! I had terrible blisters on my feet from walking daily in 100 degree temperature in . Even with painful blisters on my feet, these  made it seem like they were practically nothing. I wish all  came like the way this one is padded. If they had more colors I would buy this shoe 2 or 3 more times! "
"These are cute ! The leather is super-soft and just off white. They felt wide on my narrow foot, but I added an  and it took up the extra space. These are possibly the most comfortable ballet flat that I have ever tried!"
"This  is comfortable and even though it is a bit more narrow than some of my other , it has enough room in the toe box. I also like that it covers all of my toes completely, so you don't see toe cleavage."
"Extremely comfortable, buttery soft with good cushioning and support for a flat shoe. And the Cielo Blue color was perfect for my . The reviews say they run large. Normally I wear an 8, there was no 7.5 in stock, so I ordered a size 7. But they are too small. "
"I like these  a lot. I usually take. Size 10, but the 9.5 is best for me, maybe because my foot is a little on the narrow side. I love the fact that there is an arch and good cushioning. I may buy in another color soon. My 15 year old daughter loves them too and has asked if she can share them. We have the same sho size. They must be cute if the teen approves!"
"On the whole, these  are really comfortable, but the edge of the top of the shoe isn't super forgiving and tends to dig into my foot a little. I do love copper  and they go with a lot!"
These are really cute and comfortable but run large. I wear a 7 1/2 but will be returning them to get a 7.
"Beautiful shoe, very stylish. Gorgeous color. Unfortunately, my feet  right out of them! Tired of , but this sure isn't a good substitute"
These took 1-2 days to break in but then they were really comfortable. Very pretty too.
"These were a disappointment. I have been searching for a pair of black  to replace my wonderful  which seem to have been discontinued. When they finally arrived, I opened the box to reveal a pair of decent looking basic . They appeared well made, but when I tried them on, these  were actually too painful to stand up in, cutting into my feet at all sorts of strange angles. I normally wear an 8.5 so I ordered them in that size. My  are an 8.5 and fit perfectly. The Borns had a normal width but with a , narrow heel. They just did not agree with my feet at all. Oh well, back they go. I will not be ordering a size up. In fact, I am no longer going to buy  on the internet without having tried them on in a store first. Hopefully my  will hold a while longer until I find a suitable replacement."
"I listened to the other reviewers who said it ran small and for the first time ever ordered  a 1/2 size up. The length was perfect. My challenge with  is breaking them in because they tend to be tight across the top of my arch. Right out of the box, these are incredibly comfortable, and the soles are quiet and provide plenty of cushioning for my bad knees. I'm going to check out other colors - love these !"
"I wanted so bad to like these, but they feel narrow and long at the same time. This is very rare for any  I bought. I am sorry to send these back because they would have been perfect. But I know they'd give me blisters."
I like these even more than I thought I would. 1) They are very very lightweight. 2) They aren't flat and their padded sole/small  looks great with . I like the plain toe a lot too. 3) I worried that the butterfly and sunflower would look elementary but it makes me smile when I look down. 4) Getting these  30 hours after ordering was amazing. These do run small. I am a 7-7.5 usually and these are very nearly too short.
I am very please with this little flat. They are true to size and have more footbed comfort and  than any flat I have tried. I've compliments every time I've worn them.
"I loved these , however, they run very small, I wear a 7 to 7 1/2, I had to order 7 1/2 to 8 and they were too small. The next size is 10, very disappointed I really liked these  and none of the colors had the next size up that I needed."
This is a nice flat. I stand all day and am quite comfortable in them. The Glass Scrunched color is not quite white but close enough to wear with white. I bought my regular size and they fit nicely. I've had compliments on the style. 
This shoe is beautiful and comfortable. It comes in 4 colors (I think) and I might have to get the blue ones! Lots of compliments have come my way--they're great!
"These are super comfortable, they fit your feet so well. There's some great padding support on the bottom too. And they're super cute! I got 1/2 size smaller than what I normally wear."
"I'm unfaithful to my husband because I fell in love with these . They are comfortable, look stylish and go with many things in my wardrobe.
"
"Simply gorgeous! Sexy but incredibly comfortable. Runs true to size. Really good ""all-day"" ."
"Liked everything about this shoe. Good  which hit me perfectly. I'm not used to , so if these were comfortable right out of the box, I'm keeping them! Like the style - good for , , etc., the look is a bit but I liked that too. I was looking for a casual shoe and this one fits the bill."
These  are very cute but the size is off. I wear a 6 1\/2- 7 but my heel was hanging over the back rim by 1\/4 inch. I know the next size will be too big.

These  were adorable but the size is off. I am a true 6 1/2 - 7 but my heel was over the back rim by 1/4 of an inch.
"LOOOOOOVE this shoe. LOVE. Comfortable and sexy as Hell. I'm usually a 7, but definitely get a half size up. 7.5 fit me perfectly.
"
"I really love the look of the shoe. It looks great with a . It has nice cushioning in the bottom that makes it comfortable. The only bad thing is that it is a little tight in the toe, but it seems to be stretching a little to make it more comfortable."
Great shoe that is very comfortable. Feels as comfortable as a pair of bedroom . The design adds a burst of color and fashion.
"These  are so comfy! Well made, leather is beautiful and soft which can create dimples, but any leather this soft can have that problem. I only wish they were as white as they look on the website. They are white, but a little on the gray side and I am looking for a  shoe so we were hoping for a whiter white. Still, these are so comfortable and classy that they might be the ones! Love Zappos-will always buy from here first!"
"These are very comfortable and good looking, but the heel is a little wide for me so I use a pad in front to keep my foot from sliding (I have a very narrow heel). The first pair I ordered was too short. I had them in another color, so I knew the size was right. Zappos had a different pair to me in no time."
Great ! Thecolor goes with everything and the style is cute. They aren't a true white so if that's important you'll be unhappy.
"I have never loved a shoe more! I have problem feet that hurt when I wear any type of heel. These  were cute and comfy. Comfortable straight out of the box. Comfortable all day long. I received many compliments. I would buy a pair in every color if I could. They ran out :(. P.S. I LOVE ZAPPOS.
"
"Crazy as it sounds, these are the most comfy  I've had in forever. I'm waiting for a knee replacement next year and can tell within one minute if I can wear a shoe comfortably. I have walked all over Mexico, England and Spain in these ! The dumbest thing I've ever done is not buy three more pair immediately! Bought mine in May and by mid June there was not a 6.5 to be found in the world. I check eBay occasionally to see if any have come up. If anyone has a pair!"
Love these ...they are so comfortable. I can wear them all day to work and shopping. I got them in both black and brown. Did I say I love them?
"Love these. Just back from a trip to Ireland, alternated these with  . Looked good for going out (I'm not into skyscraper ) and I wore them to walk as much as four miles a day on city streets and even cobblestones, they were very comfortable. Bought them in brown and black; the nude is even cuter but just can't justify three pairs. I'm usually an 8, wore 7 1/2 in these."
"These are gorgeous , but I didn't notice the narrow toe and the higher heel when I ordered them, and as much as I want to keep them, I have a condition called Morton's Neuroma and I'm afraid that the ball of my foot will start to ache if I have to do much walking in these as they are snug across the widest part of the ball of my foot. Not tight, but snug and with MN, you don't even want snug. So I will reluctantly return them and search for another  mid high  with the D toe, or some other toe style, or, at least a shorter heel so that the ball of the foot isn't too much lower than the heel of the foot. They fit true to size and offer that wonderful  support and they look fantastic with  tucked inside...the base of the  would look great also if  are worn over them. I bought the short Billie  too and they are cute as a button and fit perfect and I'm keeping those. You won't be disappointed if you buy these. They were delivered to work and when I tried them on (I was wearing a  so I didn't even have the effect of  tucked in), a co-worker drooled over them. I asked her if the turquoise inset was too colorful and she said no, that was her favorite part. Indeed, when I tried them on at  with , I had to wrestle with the idea of returning them. However, I know my foot and will exchange for a  style better suited to my problem."
"Love these! I hate buying new  (hence am known for wearing my black   all the time). I saw these, ordered them and love them! They fit well, they are light weight in a good way, they are comfortable and I've received lots of compliments!"
"I absolutely love these ! The distressed color is beautiful and they are very comfortable. I wear an 8-8?Æ depending on the fit and have a bit of a wide foot. I worried the  would be too narrow so I decided to order the 8?Æ. They were too large. Thank you, Zappos, for a no hassle return policy. Size 8 is perfect! There is plenty of room to tuck in skinny  if you like that look. I do not have skinny calves and there is still room! These are wonderful  and Zappos provided wonderful service. Do not hesitate go ahead and order these . You will be pleased!"
"I was a bit apprehensive about the flower print on the foot pad, but once I put these on I forgot all about it. These are so comfortable and cute - not too high to make my feet hurt but not too low to be casual. If I didn't already have a different brown pair of Jambu's, I'd order these in brown."
"Cute and comfortable. More stylish and 'lower profile' than , but with the same comfort. These  did not require a breaking in period at all - and the flower design on the  is very cute."
"These  rocks! I recently purchased the  for my husbands 40th class reunion. I ordered a size 8 perfect fit they're the most comfortable  shoe in my wardrobe. Plan to wear often. Lots of compliments and where did I get them, Zappos.com! Great shoe!"
"Really cute , but unfortunately if you have slightly longer toes like me, they will stick out the front over the edge. And a bigger size would be too loose. "
"These are light weight, with a nice heel, and secure straps. I wore them to an  . I negotiated uneven pathways with ease, and I had no complaints from my feet after hours of dancing. "
These are beautiful . Unfortunately they were way to short and way to narrow! I would recommend buying a full size larger than your regular size. What ever happened to vanity sizing?
"I love so many things about this shoe. It is incredibly comfortable (doesn't feel like a heel at all - more comfortable than my flat  and even some ). It looks great, very pretty and delicate, not clunky at all. I just love it. So I was so disappointed when I wore it the first time - inside - and came  and discovered that the heel and sole had worn down significantly in just one day. Other than the walk through a small parking lot to my building, it was on smooth tile or carpet all day. I did not do a lot of walking, just standing. But the heel was so worn that the color had frayed off and there was a visible unevenness already. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be a replaceable heel - it's all one solid piece of plastic-y stuff - so now I am afraid to wear them again. I don't want t put heel savers on because that would make them uneven. I was so disappointed that I wrote to , and they offered me new , so weü??ll see what happens with the new pair."
"These are sexy, stylish, comfortable, and cute. You can  this shoe up or  it down.The heel is just right and the shoe is well made. I would order this shoe again in different colors."
"The cutest most comfortable  ever! They are light weight and adorable. I walked six blocks to work, around the office all day, and another six blocks  and my feet still feel great. Love them!"
I love these . Very comfortable. The size is marked 5.5-6. I would say it is a 5.5.
"These  are amazing! Cute and comfortable. How often does that happen? I wore them 8 hours on my feet in the Napa Valley the first time I put them on. I love them, and and getting them in every color!"
