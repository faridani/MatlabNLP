A butcher slams his knife onto the cutting board. An odd odor pervades the saline air, its peculiar smell a heterogeneous mixture of fish, trash, and salt from the clamoring seas. San Francisco Chinatown. Narrow streets, bustling with people, lined with homes, stores, shops and restaurants, all thrown into a messy amalgamation. And yet order exists in this conglomeration. Just as this place of structured disorganization reflects the values that its inhabitants hold dear, so too does each setting in a story bear significance to its plot, characters, themes, and various other aspects. This quality of settings is evinced by Fae Myenne Ng in her novel Bone. Told from the perspective of Leila, the eldest of three daughters born to Chinese immigrants, the story is set mainly in San Francisco’s Chinatown, but it travels around the world as it revolves around the suicide of Ona, the middle daughter, and explores how each member of the family attempts to explain her death and deal with the consequent guilt. How each character copes with this guilt is embodied by a location. Mah, the mother who blames herself for Ona’s death, is comforted by the ladies who work alongside her at the sweatshop. Nina, the youngest daughter, and Leon, the father, decide to escape from the guilt, the former by moving to New York, and the latter by embarking on a forty-day journey to Cape Horn. Leila, on the other hand, manages her conscience by refusing to leave Mah and Salmon Alley behind for her boyfriend Mason and the Mission. Yet, despite Leila’s decision to remain with her mother, Mah looks elsewhere for consolation.
Tommie Hom’s sweatshop may appear to be just another workplace where workers toil for subsistence, but in actuality, it also provides a place for socializing and bonding, and it is in such bonds that Mah finds comfort after her daughter’s death. When Mah locks herself in her bedroom following Ona’s suicide, Leila recounts how the “sewing ladies came and saved [her]…the sewing ladies knew…how to draw out Mah’s sadness and then take it away.” (Ng 102). In this passage, not only does Mah’s depression and refusal to eat signify desperation so severe as to require “saving,” but her despondency also reveals that in such trying times, she finds the most comfort in the sweatshop and her coworkers there. In fact, so effective are their consolations that they simply “draw out” Mah’s grief, as if it were a poison, and then “take it away,” suggesting that the “sewing ladies” have a profound understanding of the Mah’s psychological ailments. In this time of emotional hardship, Mah turns not to her eldest daughter, the one family member who remains by her side, but to her friends at the sweatshop, emphasizing the intimacy of their bonds and Mah’s reliance on them for comfort. Further evidence of the sweatshop’s connection to Mah’s coping mechanism is revealed when while awaiting Leon’s return from one of his voyages to a grand meal that Mah has prepared, Leila recalls hearing “a tiny hollowness: Mah was running the Singer without any fabric” (Ng 67). The sewing machine symbolizes Mah’s occupation as a seamstress and thereby acts as a link between her character and the setting of the sweatshop. The “tiny hollowness” refers to the emptiness within Mah as a result of Ona’s death, and it is this void that she tries to fill with other thoughts, perhaps a piece of cloth. Moreover, that she runs the contraption in order to reflect upon her thoughts represents the importance of the sweatshop in how she grapples with the tragedy. Thus, not only is the sweatshop a place of labor, but it is a place to socialize and gossip, and its workers as well as its machinery represent the way in which Mah deals with the blame she places upon herself for Ona’s death.
Unlike Mah, Nina’s way of dealing with her sister’s passing does not rely on local sources of comfort. Instead, she relies on the safety that comes with distance, and New York, with the length of the entire country, embodies her escape from the guilt. At one point, as Leila reflects upon her youngest sister’s feelings about Ona’s suicide, she ponders the possible reasons for Nina’s flight. She realizes that “Nina blamed [them], this family. Everybody. Everything. Salmon Alley. The whole place. That’s why she’s in New York now” (Ng 48). This excerpt abounds with various settings which act as mediums for referring to actual people and cultures. Nina liberates herself from the weight of Ona’s death by “[blaming] this family” and “Salmon Alley” and subsequently running away to “New York,” the former place epitomizing all of the sadness, guilt, and shame, and the latter place representing emotional freedom and happiness. Through the juxtaposition of these two settings, we understand that Nina does not actually cope with the suicide. Instead, she runs away from her problems and pains by fleeing the source. While Salmon Alley is depicted as old and cramped, New York exudes an atmosphere of novelty and refinement. Even the Chinatown of New York seems more airy, as when Leila visits Nina in New York and walks through Chinatown, she notes that “[she] liked the urgent, time-pressed feeling…No strollers, everyone was in a hurry” (Ng 34). In contrast to the Chinatown of San Francisco, which is depicted as drab and filled with tattered old men like Leon, New York’s Chinatown seems to be bustling; “no strollers” and an “urgent, time-pressed feeling” suggests that there isn’t a single person without a place to go, an errand to run, a deadline to meet. New York is a perfect getaway for those looking to escape the sorrows of death by busying themselves with life, and Nina is looking for just that.
Much like his daughter, Leon takes the route of escape when dealing with the guilt that he experiences following Ona’s suicide. Shortly after Ona jumped, he loses himself and decides to leave all of the sorrow behind for awhile. Leila recounts that not long after her sister’s death, “Leon shipped out on a cargo voyage. Cape Horn was as far away as a ship could go. Forty days to the bottom of the world” (47). Leon appears to be escaping when he travels “as far away as a ship could go,” but his reasons for fleeing are not quite identical to those of his youngest daughter. Similar to Nina, he attempts to place a safe distance, “forty days” sailing to be precise, between himself and the death of Ona. Yet, unlike her, he also voyages as a self punishment, banishing himself to the “bottom of the world.” A constant location does not exist for which to point to as an embodiment of Leon’s guilt: Cape Horn is merely one of his many destinations. Rather, it is the lack of such a fixed place that truly symbolizes Leon’s way of coping with these sentiments. By always being abroad, Leon will naturally think about his family, and through this process, he constantly remind himself of the memories of Ona and the immense pain and guilt that follow closely behind.
In stark contrast to her father and youngest sister, Leila instead remains relatively nearby to where Ona died: home. In fact, Leila is so strongly attached to her home on Salmon Alley that she feels uncomfortable staying at Mason’s place for the first time since Ona’s death, despite the fact that she normally views her boyfriend’s place as a home away from home. She remembers that that night, “something about staying in the Mission felt like [she] was crashing out at somebody else’s place…Salmon Alley felt like the only safe place” (Ng 117). In response to Ona’s death, Leila feels as though she must stay close to home, to her mother, where it is “safe.” It is her way of dealing with never knowing for certain why her sister took her own life; she remains close to “Salmon Alley,” the place where they grew up, where the treasure trove of memories lay immovable, so that she can not only remember Ona, but alleviate her guilt by helping out Mah. As a location, Salmon Alley best defines Leila’s character: she can never leave everything behind like Nina does, the memories, the people, even the guilt. Even at the end of the road, when she is moving in with Mason for good, she does not relinquish Salmon Alley within her heart. She reassures herself that “[she] wasn’t worried when [she] turned that corner, leaving the old blue sign, Salmon Alley, Mah and Leon—everything—backdaire” (191). This passage suggests that Leila has come to terms with Ona’s death by remaining in Salmon Alley with all of the memories sealed within her home, the misspelled “backdaire” sign the embodiment of these recollections. It highlights the notion that though Leila finally “turned that corner,” she does intend to flee from her feelings. Rather, she departs with a profound understanding and acceptance of her guilt and shame, and she decides to take everything with her. She has miniaturized Salmon Alley, all of its memories, happiness, sadness, guilt, and stuffed it into her heart. Leila deals with Ona’s death by never parting with her home, tradition, and family. 
Thus far, we have only examined how the manner in which each character has dealt with Ona’s death can be related to a setting in the story. But we must not neglect the possibility that Ona’s character is also embodied in such a location. Toward the beginning of the novel, when Leila is on her way to tell Mah about her marriage with Mason, she divulges that her middle sister jumped off the M floor of the Nam. She describes the location: “next to the school is the Nam Ping Yuen, the last of the four housing projects built in Chinatown. Nam means south and ping yuen…something like ‘peaceful gardens’” (Ng 12). Though not much is revealed about the physical qualities of the place, much of its significance lies within its name. The name put together bears a connotation of mystery and mysticism, that perhaps before she jumped, Ona saw clearly the problems of the world from which she fled. She died a peaceful death, as evidenced by “ping” meaning peace, yet that the Nam was the “last of the four housing projects” exudes an aura of spookiness and morbidity, since in Chinese, the number four sounds similar to the word for death. This paradox in meaning parallels the mystery that surrounds Ona’s character and why she committed suicide. Leila does provide recollections of Ona as curious, happy, and playful, but even she admits that Ona is good at hiding things, at keeping secrets. Thus like the characters in the story, we will never know Ona’s inner thoughts, just as we will never know the true significance of the nam ping yuen.
Ultimately, the settings in Fae Myenne Ng’s novel Bone are like characters. Though not all of these places are detailed with vivid physical descriptions, their emotional qualities are elucidated through those of the human characters and their associations with these places. Mah’s character is presented through how she copes with Ona’s death through the bonds that she has formed in her workplace. Nina and Leon exhibit their more capricious personalities by making a getaway from all of the guilt and shame, their destinations (or lack thereof) embodying this spirit, and Leila, at the other end of the spectrum, displays her steadfast loyalty and obligation to her family by remaining beside Mah all throughout the novel, a quality embodied by their home, Salmon Alley. Just as these places exist throughout the real world, so do these kinds of people with these kinds of personalities. There are those who rely on others to deal with their troubles, those who run away from these problems, and those who confront these pains on their own, and perhaps there exists a bit of each of these tendencies within every one of us. However, regardless of which one we might aspire to be, we must remember to never forget our home, because when the world is falling apart, when there is no one left to turn to, the only people you have are your family and your home. Leila understands this, and in the end it is she who finds peace of mind and is able to put her guilt to eternal rest.

The Declaration of Independence: A Transcription

IN CONGRESS, July 4, 1776.

The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America,

When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.

He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.
He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.
He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only. 
He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures. 
He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.
He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.
He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.
He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.
He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.
He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.
He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.
He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.
He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:
For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:
For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:
For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:
For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent: 
For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:
For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences
For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:
For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:
For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.
He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.
He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people. 
He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.
He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands. 
He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.

In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.

Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.

We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.
